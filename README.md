# Cryptocurrencies

## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report including the traded cryptocurrencies classified by group according to their features.
This classification report could be used by an investment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients.

We've used the following methods for the to complete our analysis:

  * preprocessing the database,
  * reducing the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis,
  * clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means,
  * visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.
